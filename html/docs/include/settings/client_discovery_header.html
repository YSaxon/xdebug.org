<p>If [CFG:client_discovery_header] is configured to be a non-empty string, then the
value is used as key in the <code>$_SERVER</code> superglobal array to determine
which header to use to find the IP address or hostname to use for 'connecting
back to'. This setting is only used in combination with
[CFG:discover_client_host] and is otherwise ignored.</p>

<p>For example, if [CFG:client_discovery_header] is set to
<code>HTTP_FORWARD_HOST</code>, then Xdebug will check
<code>$_SERVER['HTTP_FORWARD_HOST']</code> to obtain the IP address to use for
'connecting back'.</p>

<p>It is possible to configure multiple fallbacks by using a comma separated
list of values. For example if you want to use <code>HTTP_FORWARD_HOST</code>
first, and then also want to check <code>REMOTE_ADDR</code>, then you set
[CFG:client_discovery_header] to
<code>HTTP_FORWARD_HOST,REMOTE_ADDR</code>.</p>

<p class="warning">PHP automatically prepends <code>HTTP_</code>, and converts
<code>-</code> to <code>_</code>, for received HTTP header names. The
<code>THIS-IS-MY-HOST</code> HTTP header is converted into
<code>$_SERVER['HTTP_THIS_IS_MY_HOST']</code>. Therefore, the
[CFG:client_discovery_header] needs to be set to
<code>HTTP_THIS_IS_MY_HOST</code> to match this.</p>

<p>If you have logging enabled, and set the [CFG:log_level] setting to
<code>10</code>, then Xdebug will list every header, the header value, and the
used header (if any) when attempting to find the IP address to connect back
to.</code>

<p class="note">Xdebug 3.2 and later no longer fall back to the 
<code>$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']</code> and
<code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> header values by default. If you want
these headers to be used as well, you specifically need to add these to the
list of headers, by setting [CFG:client_discovery_header] to
<code>YOUR_OWN_HEADER,HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR,REMOTE_ADDR</code>.</p>
