<h1>Introducing Xdebug AI!</h1>
<p style="text-align: right; opacity: 0.33">April 1st, 2023</p>
<p>
Xdebug AI is a new powerful PHP debugging tool in development,
that will use machine learning to identify and fix bugs in your code.
With Xdebug AI, you can focus on what you do best, which is
writing clean and efficient code, while Xdebug AI takes care of
the rest.
</p>
<p>
Xdebug AI uses years worth of training data, analyzing the
patterns and common errors in the code to improve its accuracy over time.
With each bug that you create, Xdebug AI gets smarter and more
efficient at identifying and fixing similar bugs in the future.
</p>
<p>
We believe that machine learning can revolutionize the way
developers debug their code, and we want to bring this technology to
everyone. That's why we're launching this campaign
to take Xdebug to the next level.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to raise funds to further develop Xdebug and Xdebug AI,
and make it accessible to PHP developers worldwide. With your support,
we can:

    <li>Add new features, such as time travel debugging</li>
    <li>Create user-friendly tutorials and documentation to help developers get started with Xdebug quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>
We're passionate about making Xdebug AI the best debugging tool for
PHP developers, and we need your help to make it happen. By supporting
this funding campaign, you'll be helping us bring machine learning to PHP
development and revolutionize the way developers debug their code.
